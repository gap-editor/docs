# Bug Bounty

{% hint style="info" %}
## ðŸ“œ **TL;DR:**

* This page describes general best practices for reporting bugs and specific reporting guidelines for Hemi code contained within the [hemilabs](https://github.com/hemilabs/) GitHub organization.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Do not** disclose vulnerabilities publicly or by executing them against a production network. If you do, you will not only be putting users at risk, but you will forfeit your right to a reward. Always follow the appropriate reporting pathways as described below.

* **Do not** disclose the vulnerability publicly, for example by filing a public ticket.
* **Do not** test the vulnerability on a publicly available network, either the testnet or the mainnet.
