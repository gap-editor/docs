# Bug Report

{% hint style="info" %}
## ðŸ“œ **TL;DR:**

* This page describes general best practices for reporting bugs and specific reporting guidelines for Hemi code contained within the [Hemi Labs GitHub](https://github.com/hemilabs/) organization.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Do not** disclose vulnerabilities publicly or by executing them against a production network. If you do, you will not only be putting users at risk, but you will forfeit your right to a reward. Always follow the appropriate reporting pathways.
