**Note:** The following commands connect to a Hemi Labs-owned BFG. This BFG can get busy and requests will often time out due to a high load and serving the large number of connected users. If you'd like to run your own, you can do so by following [the instructions](https://github.com/hemilabs/heminetwork?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-running-bfgd) then you may connect to that with by changing the `POPM_BFG_URL` value to be your own BFG.
