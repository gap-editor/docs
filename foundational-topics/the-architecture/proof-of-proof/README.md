# Proof-of-Proof (PoP)

{% hint style="info" %}
## üìú **TL;DR:**

* The Hemi Network utilizes **Proof-of-Proof (PoP)** to leverage Bitcoin's renowned security.
* **PoP Miners** enhance security by publishing Hemi's network data on Bitcoin's blockchain.
* Bitcoin confirmations further bolster Hemi's defenses, ensuring a robust and secure network.

## üõ°Ô∏è Inherits Bitcoin's Security

* Hemi's network capitalizes on Bitcoin's formidable security through a mechanism known as **Proof-of-Proof (PoP)**. This approach allows Hemi to inherit the solid Proof-of-Work (PoW) security of Bitcoin.

***

## üîç How?

* To achieve this, Hemi deploys specialized miners, referred to as **PoP Miners**. These miners are responsible for:
  * Gathering crucial network details and publishing them on Bitcoin's blockchain, thereby linking Hemi's security directly to Bitcoin's proven system.
  * Employing sophisticated algorithms to generate proofs that are vital for the network's security.
  * Ensuring Hemi's network integrity by leveraging Bitcoin's security, providing a dual layer of protection.
* This integration with the Bitcoin blockchain affords Hemi an additional security layer, utilizing Bitcoin's PoW system as a basis for resolving disputes and ensuring trustworthiness.

***

## üèóÔ∏è Block Confirmations

* New segments in the Hemi chain receive confirmations from Bitcoin, significantly raising the barrier for potential attacks. These confirmations:
  * Serve as **"security bricks,"** each one strengthening the network's defenses.
  * Ensure that any attempt to compromise the network requires substantial power, making unnoticed attacks virtually impossible.
  * As Bitcoin confirmations accumulate, the Hemi Network's "security wall" becomes increasingly formidable, creating an effective deterrent against malicious actors.

***

## üîö Conclusion

* The **Proof-of-Proof (PoP) consensus mechanism** uniquely positions the Hemi Network by:
  * Allowing Bitcoin miners to secure Hemi indirectly, without direct involvement in Hemi's consensus processes.
  * Facilitating scalable transaction throughput in the Hemi ecosystem without expanding its Bitcoin footprint significantly.
  * Setting a high barrier for network reorganizations, as disrupting Hemi would necessitate a highly improbable 51% attack on Bitcoin itself, a task too daunting even for nation-states.
* This approach not only extends Bitcoin's security to the Hemi Network but also introduces a scalable, robust framework for transaction processing and network integrity.
