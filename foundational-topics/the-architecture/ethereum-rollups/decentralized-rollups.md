# Decentralized Rollups

{% hint style="info" %}
## 📜 **TL;DR:**

* The **Hemi Network** champions decentralized roles, leverages Bitcoin's security, promotes open participation, fault tolerance, and fee efficiency to enhance Layer 2 solutions.

***

## **🌐 Overview**

* In contrast to other Layer 2 (L2) rollup solutions, the Hemi Network introduces a more decentralized approach to data publication and validation, addressing critical issues present in current L2 setups:
  * **✅ Decentralized Roles:** Introduces a decentralized approach with Publishers handling key roles asynchronously, mitigating the risks associated with centralized control found in other L2 networks.
  * **✅ Incentivized Participation:** Allows open participation through staking tokens with Ethereum-side validation contracts, fostering consistent and incentivized data sharing even during times of increased fee activity.
  * **✅ Fault Tolerance and Reward System:** Implements a system to discourage malicious behavior, slashing stakes of Publishers submitting invalid data while rewarding Challengers who identify faults, thereby promoting network integrity.
  * **✅ Efficient Ethereum Fee Management:** Manages rewards via Ethereum-side validation contracts, ensuring consistent incentives for Publishers despite Ethereum fee fluctuations.
