***

## üåê Overview

* The Hemi Bitcoin Kit (hBK) Demo App is a tool designed for developers to interact with Bitcoin blockchain data directly from an Ethereum-compatible environment.&#x20;
* This demo app provides a user-friendly interface for querying Bitcoin information.
* By abstracting the complexities of interacting with Bitcoin data, the app allows developers to seamlessly retrieve and use Bitcoin blockchain data in their dApps without needing external services.&#x20;
* This makes it an effective resource for experimenting with Bitcoin-aware applications and understanding hBK‚Äôs capabilities within the Hemi ecosystem.
