# Web PoP Miner

{% hint style="info" %}
## 📜 **TL;DR:**

* In this tutorial, we will run a [web-based PoP Miner](https://pop-miner.hemi.xyz)**.**
* The web PoP miner is designed for ease of use, allowing users of all experience levels to test and run their own PoP miner.&#x20;
* We recommend storing only a **limited amount of working funds** in the wallet associated with the webminer.&#x20;
* The web PoP miner includes a helpful dashboard for viewing the latest transactions/publications, including their status and cost.

## 🌐 Overview

* The web PoP miner is designed for ease of use, allowing users of any experience level to test and run their own PoP miner.&#x20;
* Due to its lightweight nature, it requires no specific hardware, making it accessible from any standard computer.&#x20;
* While it is not intended for long-term mining operations, it serves as an excellent entry point for users interested in transitioning to the more durable CLI version, providing an introduction to Hemi's architecture and its unique integration with the Bitcoin network.

## 🔐 Security Note

{% hint style="warning" %}
* The web miner uses the same secure code as the CLI miner. However, it also relies on your web browser, which introduces additional security risks.&#x20;
* Therefore, we recommend storing only a **limited amount of working funds** in the wallet associated with the web-based miner. For long-term use, consider using the CLI PoP Miner.
* When transitioning to the CLI PoP Miner, **it is recommended to generate a new public key.** Private key information obtained via the web PoP Miner, although encrypted, is not fully secure and is not meant for extended mining operations.&#x20;

### **3. Fund your Bitcoin Address**

* Fund your Bitcoin address _(see screenshot)_, to pay for gas required during PoP mining.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Please ensure you transfer at least `0.002 tBTC` to the provided address to start PoP mining.
{% endhint %}

### **4. Confirm Key and Begin Mining!**

* Once your key is set, click "**Continue**" to start the mining process.

{% hint style="info" %}
To ensure your PoP miner stays active, keep the browser tab open. If you close the tab, your miner will shut down and you will need to import the private key assigned in Step 2 to restart it.

## 👀 Monitoring Your Mining

* The dashboard displays your **tHEMI** and **tBTC** **balances**. A tBTC balance is required to pay for gas fees published to the Bitcoin network. tHEMI is rewarded to addresses running a PoP node for participating in and securing the Hemi Network.
* The web-based PoP miner includes a helpful dashboard for viewing the latest transactions/publications, including their status and cost.
