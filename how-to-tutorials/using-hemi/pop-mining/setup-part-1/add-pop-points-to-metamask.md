# (Mainnet) Add PoPPoints to Metamask

{% hint style="info" %}
üìú **TL;DR:**

* **Prior to TGE, PoP miners on mainnet will receive PoPPoints tokens.**
* These points are entirely  separate from the Incentivized Testnet / Mainnet seasons.
* View your tHEMI balance and transactions directly in MetaMask.
* The tHEMI token contract address is `0xC5D2E164601c59c2cD760669e849BFe498003e21`.

## üåêOverview

Prior to TGE, users who engage in securing Hemi (mainnet) to Bitcoin will receive PoPPoints tokens, which are distributed based on how many other users are actively PoP Mining.\
\
These PoPPoints tokens are initially non-transferrable. During the initial mainnet release, all miners who get a PoP publication for a keystone into Bitcoin within \~1.6 hours will share 100 PoPPoints for that keystone round.

As mainnet evolves, this payout algorithm will be adjusted.

* If the address is recognized, MetaMask will automatically populate the `Token Symbol` and `Token Decimal` fields. For PoPPoints, you should see a symbol `POP`and 18 decimals.

* If successful, you should see your PoPPoints tokens in your wallet's token list:

For now, these tokens are non-transferrable.
