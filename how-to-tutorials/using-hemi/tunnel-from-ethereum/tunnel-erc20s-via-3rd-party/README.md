# Tunnel ERC20s via 3rd Party

{% hint style="info" %}
## 📜 **TL;DR:**

* For these assets, you can use one of several third-party tunnel solutions to move tokens between Ethereum and Hemi.

## 🔄 Why Use a Third-Party Bridge?

Hemi’s native Tunnel supports a range of popular ERC-20 tokens. However, some assets (e.g., USDC, USDT) are not yet integrated. In these cases, a third-party bridge provides:

• Fast bridging times.

• Established track record of security and reliability.

• Wide token support, including stablecoins like USDC and USDT.
